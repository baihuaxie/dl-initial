    "### The concept of inheritance\n",
    "*  terminology:\n",
    "    * classes that inherit from another are called derived classe, subclasses or subtypes\n",
    "    * classes from which other classes are derived are called base classes or superclasses\n",
    "    * inherit, derive, extend are usually used interchangably in this context\n",
    "* class inheritance models a 'is a' relationship\n",
    "    * so in principle, if class A inherits class B, we can say sth like 'an object of class A is an object of class B'\n",
    "* the Liskov substitution principle:\n",
    "    * in a computer program, if S is a subtype of T, then objects of type T may be replaced by objects of type S without altering any of the desired properties of the program\n",
    "    * class hiearchy must always follow the Liskov principle\n",
    "* interface and implementation:\n",
    "    * the base class describes a common interface\n",
    "    * the derived classes share the common interface and specialize by providing a particular implementation\n",
    "    * objects of the base class can then be replaced by objects of any of the derived classes"
