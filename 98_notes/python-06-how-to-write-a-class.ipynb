    "### __repr__ and __str__\n",
    "* both are intrinsic (want of a better word?) Python class methods that prints out contents about the class\n",
    "* refer to [this great answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1436703/difference-between-str-and-repr) about their difference and usage\n",
    "* in a nutshell:\n",
    "    * __repr__ prints out the contents of a class object for it to be unambiguous -> the reader is likely a fellow programmer (or myself) doing debugging on the class\n",
    "        * so:\n",
    "            * a) every (important?) class should overload a __repr__ method;\n",
    "            * b) __repr__ method should print in such a way that answers this question: what do I need to know about this class if something went wrong involving an object of it?\n",
    "    * __str__ prints out the contents of a class object for it to be readable -> the reader is likely a user\n",
    "        * so only classes that handles strings, texts, dates, etc., i.e., that needed to print something out, would need to overload a __str__ method\n",
